            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Taking a nap in the afternoon can lead to some very weird dreams.
                At one point I was flying in the sky and the next I am having an epic sword fight for the love a beautiful girl.
                What are dreams and how do they come about.  
                Dreams involve imagery in the absence of external stimulation and can seem very real (textbook).
                Dreams tend to be more vivid during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is the last stage in the sleep cycle, whereas images are less clear in the other stages of sleep or NREM(Non-rapid eye movement stages.
                Although dreams can take one on various outlandish journeys, they are usually based on real life situations or problems the individual is going through.
                The urges and dilemmas that people go through are often reflected in dreams, and the subjects of these dreams tend to be people one would know, like family and friends.
                These people are sometimes referred to as “the residue of the day” (Textbook).  
                Often people wonder about the dreams they have and want to interpret their meaning.  
                Individuals do this through what is termed as dream analysis, which are performed by psychologists but can also been done to one’s self.  
                Carl Jung said, “The dream has for the primitive an incomparably higher value than it has for civilized man. 
                Not only does he talk a great deal about his dreams, he also attributes an extraordinary importance to them, so that it often seems as though he were unable to distinguish between them and reality. 
                To the civilized man dreams as a rule appear valueless, though there are some people who attach great significance to certain dreams on account of their weird and impressive character. 
                This peculiarity lends plausibility to the view that dreams are inspirations”.
                Dreams can hold different value for different people, and as such can be interpreted in different ways (Rathus, 2008).</p>

            <h1>History of Dreams</h1>
            <p>Many believe that dream analysis was started by Freud and Jung. However dream interpretations have gone on since ancient times. 
                Many times the dreams and interpretations depicted future events.   
                In an ancient Babylonian story, The Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh has a dream where an axe falls from the heavens. 
                He then throws the axe in front of his mother and then embraces it dearly.  
                His mother then interprets this dream saying that he would face a great enemy but then would become the best of friends.  
                Another story in the book of Genesis describes another dream interpreter.  
                The story of Joseph takes place where Joseph was chosen by God.  
                He was sold into slavery by his brothers.  
                During his time in slavery, he was put in jail.  
                Two servants to the Pharaoh had disturbing dreams and Joseph interpreted them.  
                The Pharaoh then had a terrible dream that no one could interpret and sent for Joseph.  
                Joseph was able to interpret dream predicting there would be 7 years of good fortune for crops followed by a 7 year famine.  
                Both stories are indicators of how important dream analysis was in ancient times.  
                In modern times, the theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung helped to shape how the world views dream analysis today (Wikipedia).</p>

            <h1>Theories of Dream Analysis</h1>
            <p>There are many different views on dream analysis.  
                Some disregard it completely while some embrace it wholeheartedly.  
                The desire to known what possibilities dream holds for them is enticing to many people.</p>

                <h2>Freud</h2>
                <p>Freud described psychoanalytic dream interpretation as “the royal road to the knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind” (Wikipedia).  
                Freud’s view of dream analysis in psychoanalysis helped to bring the idea into the modern mainstream.  
                Freud saw dreams as a person’s unconscious desire coming true.  
                Dreams were meant to be wish-fulfilling for a person.  
                Often times, this person’s wish was repressed into the unconscious mind.  
                Freud theorized that the content of the dreams were symbolic of unconscious fantasized objects, such as genitals.  
                This is different that how ancient civilizations viewed it.  
                Freud viewed certain objects as symbolic of something.  
                Often anything that was long and jutted out could represent the male genitals.  
                Freud also suggested that dreams protected sleep by providing imagery that kept disturbing or repressed thoughts out of the conscious or subconscious (Chiriac).</p>

                <h2>Carl Jung</h2>
                <p>Carl Jung is another person credited with his theory of dream analysis.  
                He however differed from Freud’s view. 
                Jung thought that Freud’s view was too simple to describe dream.  
                Jung thought dreams were much more complex to understanding.  
                As such Jung proposed that there were two levels to a dream: the objective level and the subjective level.  
                The objective level is where dream has real life portrayals of people, places, events, and activities that the person has experienced in their daily life.  
                The subjective level is where the dreams portray personifications or symbolic images of the person’s emotions and of their true psyche.  
                Jung theorized that understanding a dream takes understanding both levels of it, not just one like Freud thought. (Buckley).</p>
                <p>Another aspect of Jung’s theory focuses on the two functions of dreams. One is to compensate for imbalances in the consciousness.  
                Dreams help to make what the conscious mind represses or forgets about and bring it to the surface.  
                When a person recognizes and accepts the repressed actions or feelings, they can achieve a balanced psyche.  
                The other function is to bring prospective to the future.  
                While dreams serve to remind individuals of the past, like Freud says, they can also give hints or glimpses of a possible future (like the ancient dream interpreters believed).  
                Jung believed that the ultimate purpose of a dream is to unite the conscious and unconscious minds in harmony.  
                He referred to this as individuation, or the complete actualization of the whole human being (a Gestalt school of thought).  (Buckley)</p>
                <p>Jung also theorized that dreams hold universal images common to human beings.  He called these the archetypes of dreams.  
                Common archetypes include the wise old man, the great mother, the divine child, the trickster, and the shadow.  
                These archetypes model people, behaviors, or personalities. (Buckley (Wikipedia Users))</p>

                <h2>Biologists</h2>
                <p>The biologists view the meanings of dreams through the activations-synthesis model.  
                The activation-synthesis model is the view that dreams reflect activation of cognitive activity by the reticular activating system and synthesis of this activity into a pattern by the cerebral cortex.  
                The activation of the reticular activating system arouses humans but not to the point of waking up.  
                The reticular activating system also stimulates brain activity in parts of the cortex.  
                The cortex synthesizes the sources of stimulation, which yields to dreams.  
                In this view, dreams are more emotional than coherent to the dreamer (Rathus, 2008).</p>

            <h1>What Did We Learn</h1>
            <p>The psychoanalytic dream interpretation that Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung founded helped to build the way modern psychologists view and interpret dreams of human beings.  
                Freud started with the concept that dreams were a way of wish-fulfillment for people.  
                People’s unconscious desires were brought to the surface through their dreams and the objects in those dreams were symbols for other things.  
                Like Freud, Jung believed that dreams held symbols in place of other things.  
                This he called the subjective level.  
                However, Jung also believed another level of dreams existed.  
                The objective level of dreams held that everyday activities were also incorporated into dreams.  
                The mother in the dream is the actual mother in real life.  
                Jung believed that being able to unite both levels could lead to a true understanding of a person.  
                The works of these two psychologists brought dream interpretation to the mainstream people and forever changed the way people saw their dreams.</p>
